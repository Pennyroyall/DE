#Stability

Stability and robustness analysis of linear time-invariant systems of differential equations with 
concentrated delays. Parameters to be estimated are margin of stability and value of overshoot. Main 
approaches are
* classical Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals
* Machine-learning based algorithm
